The Mozilla Stumbler project is an open-source wireless network scanner that collects GPS and wireless network data for crowd-sourced location database. For a layman, you just turn it and your location on, set your nick and it stumbles for you. Everyone was going gaga over Mozstumbler Delhi NCR V 1.0, hoping to win the t-shirt, and I was the one with the lowest score. People had already scored 10k before the trip started and I was home with 30 points. Well, that’s what you get for traveling in Los Santos.</p>
<h1 id="And-it-begins"><a href="#And-it-begins" class="headerlink" title="And it begins!"></a>And it begins!</h1><p>Mostly sleepless night (Who can sleep at 9 p.m. ?), but I still tried to catch some sleep. Failing that, got up and at em before the alarm went off. Took a cab till Subash Nagar and then hitched a ride with Tanshul. I was mesmerized yet again by Delhi’s Night. I don’t have pictures, but it was magnificent. We reached the MozTraveler at exactly 4:30 a.m. and drove off to pick others up. Faced a flat tire near Mahipalpur, but that couldn’t get our spirits down.</p>

<p>IFFCO Chowk at 5 a.m. and everybody was on board. We started with the ‘Pure Hindi’ game and I took my cue to enter ninja mode. My total penalty was of 20 bucks only, that must be an achievement granted my history with Hindi language. We stopped for some MozCoffee and MozBreakfast. The rest of the way, all we did was play Cards and watch a movie (I have no idea who was watching!). Hilarious moment of the day: Shubham went to take a leak and disappeared for 15 minutes. I’m still trying to figure out what he was up to. We reached our hotel by 11 a.m. and, hence, began the selfie session. We got some rest and made our way to Jantar Mantar. We decided on skipping Lunch because we didn’t have time for it (Who doesn’t have time for food?). We reached Jantar Mantar, ensuing yet another selfie session. We were having fun and then started the rain and with it our short but fun run to MozTraveler. I had 6000+ stumbling points by now (not bad!). Next stop, Nahargarh fort. En route, we saw Jal Mahal which was stunning to say the least. Suddenly, we started climbing mountains and I held onto dear life. I didn’t know that this fort was supposed to be on a mountain. I, being acrophobic, was holding dearly to my seat. Thanks to the amazing weather, I was able to overcome it enough to not be paranoid about it.</p>

<p>We made way to our hotel but caught some snacks at Lakshmi Mishthan Bhandar, one of the oldest shop in Jaipur (Thank you, Pushpita, for the name). We reached back to the hotel. Tired? We were not. Some rest and we had a nice short meeting about our projects which was followed by an amazing dinner. The dinner was followed by everyone assembling in Lovnish’s room. Sanyam and I still had somethings about the website to bore everyone with. But soon, everyone gave up on us and Ajay started with his ghost stories, which made many people leave the room and some others that did stay, slept with their room lights on. Around 1 a.m., everyone is tired and going to sleep. Anup and I had plans to grab some chilled ones, but he was tired and said he won’t be able to do it. So, I head back to my room and attack the mini bar, luckily the YMCA team joins Tanshul and I to play some cards. I taught em blackjack and emptied the mini bar in my room. 2:30 a.m. and I was sleeping like a baby.</p>
<h1 id="Still-have-the-MozPower"><a href="#Still-have-the-MozPower" class="headerlink" title="Still have the MozPower!"></a>Still have the MozPower!</h1><p>8:15 a.m. : Everybody was having breakfast together. Everyone packed their stuff and checked out of their room by 10 a.m. , We shot a video for Stumbler project and ensued yet another selfie session. Hilarious moment of the day: Screaming FoxYeah in the middle of the hotel, out of nowhere, and scaring the crap out of everyone. Next stop, Amer Fort. Our driver successfully duped us by telling us that the walking distance to the fort is about an hour long, so we should take a cab. After reaching the fort, we realized that the walking distance was hardly 15 minutes long. We reached the fort and it was humongous. We realized that we’d need a guide so we looked around and we found MozGuide.<br><img src="/blog/img/mozguide-full.jpg" class="class mozguide" width="300" height="300" title="Le Mozguide Le Mozguide"><br>MozGuide taught us a lot about the place and I fell in love with Sheesh Mahal, but it was time to bid goodbye to the pink city. We made our way to Delhi and started a game of Dumb Charades on our way. Our team was allegedly called out on cheating but the other team had no proof. Due to our traveler’s tire bursting (yet again!), we were delayed. If the tire wasn’t enough, Kunal got food poisoning. The entire return could have been a disaster for everyone because of this, but we couldn’t give up the MozPower! After successfully getting the tire changed and getting Kunal the medicines he needed, we started a game of truth and dare. Some epic moments like Vikram’s nagin dance and Bhuvnesh’s miss fresher story ensued. I was spared thanks to Jay (Thank you, bro) asking me the easiest question one could ask. Around 12 a.m. everyone reached home safely and I made 9000 points . It was awesome to be part of Mozpacers on this trip and I’m going to cherish these moments. I’m going to end with a quote.<br><blockquote><p>Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one’s lifetime</p>
